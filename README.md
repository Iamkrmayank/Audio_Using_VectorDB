# Youtube_Audio_Transcripts_Using_VectorDB

# Youtube_transcripts

# Description
Possess the ability to parse every video on a YouTube channel or playlist, extract audio transcripts, and embed the videos in a vector database so that search and retrieval are possible.

# Implementation Details
It will consist of the following:

* Get the user's playlist or channel link.
* Take audio clips out of every video in the playlist or link.
* Take out the timestamps and transcripts from each video.
* Make chunks from the transcript (you may use any fancy chunking algorithm or just use basic chunks like four minutes of audio).
* Use an LLM call to summarise each video, then save each chunk separately.
* Use COLBERT to embed this in a vector database (Ragatoullie - LangChain). Make use of this as a guide.
* Turn on COLBERT retrieval and search for the embedded information.
* A search for a question returns obtain the necessary content's timestamps, a YouTube link, and similar content.

# Youtube Vector Search DB Contribution

"Youtube Vector Search DB Contribution" likely refers to a system or process involving YouTube, vector search, and database contributions. Here's a breakdown:

YouTube: This suggests that the project involves YouTube, a popular video-sharing platform. It might include tasks related to video content, metadata, or interactions with the YouTube API.

Vector Search: Vector search involves using mathematical vectors to represent data points and perform efficient similarity searches. In the context of YouTube, this could relate to content-based similarity searches, such as finding videos with similar content or features.

Database Contribution: This implies that there's a database involved, and the term "contribution" suggests the act of adding or updating information within that database. Contributions could include adding video metadata, user interactions, or vector representations to enhance search capabilities.

Possible Tasks:
Vector Representation: Generating and storing vector representations for YouTube videos based on their content features. This can be achieved using techniques like deep learning or other machine learning approaches.

Database Integration: Incorporating the vector representations into a database, enabling efficient and accurate similarity searches.

Contributions: Allowing users or systems to contribute additional information to the database, such as tagging, categorization, or other metadata.

Search Functionality: Implementing a search functionality that leverages vector representations to find videos with similar content efficiently.
